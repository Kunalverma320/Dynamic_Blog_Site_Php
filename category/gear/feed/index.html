										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, some friends and I rented a 30&#8242; camper van and drove to an area in the Angeles National Forest known as Devil&#8217;s Punchbowl.</p>
<p>We met up Friday evening after everyone got off work, loaded up the camper, and headed on our way. It was a pretty smooth ride until we hit the inclines on Highway 14 where our humongous camper van struggled to maintain a 30mph pace.</p>

<p>The morning after we arrived, we made coffee and breakfast inside of the RV before heading out to explore the area. It was awesome being in the camper and having a nice, comfortable place to hang out, cook, and eat before starting our hike along the Punchbowl Loop Trail.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day a storm began rolling in so after having dinner in the camper (spaghetti bolognese!) we decided to get ourselves a little closer home so we can cut down on the driving the next day. We stopped in a town with a Walmart and asked them if we could park overnight there. After we parked we realized that our grey water tank was overflowing and the water was backing up into the sink (not cool). We headed out to a local dump station and figured out how to dump the grey and black water from the RV before spending the night playing games and hanging out at the Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun hanging out in the RV with everyone and getting out into nature to shoot some photos!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, some friends and I rented a 30&#8242; camper van and drove to an area in the Angeles National Forest known as Devil&#8217;s Punchbowl.</p>
<p>We met up Friday evening after everyone got off work, loaded up the camper, and headed on our way. It was a pretty smooth ride until we hit the inclines on Highway 14 where our humongous camper van struggled to maintain a 30mph pace.</p>

<p>The morning after we arrived, we made coffee and breakfast inside of the RV before heading out to explore the area. It was awesome being in the camper and having a nice, comfortable place to hang out, cook, and eat before starting our hike along the Punchbowl Loop Trail.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day a storm began rolling in so after having dinner in the camper (spaghetti bolognese!) we decided to get ourselves a little closer home so we can cut down on the driving the next day. We stopped in a town with a Walmart and asked them if we could park overnight there. After we parked we realized that our grey water tank was overflowing and the water was backing up into the sink (not cool). We headed out to a local dump station and figured out how to dump the grey and black water from the RV before spending the night playing games and hanging out at the Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun hanging out in the RV with everyone and getting out into nature to shoot some photos!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, some friends and I rented a 30&#8242; camper van and drove to an area in the Angeles National Forest known as Devil&#8217;s Punchbowl.</p>
<p>We met up Friday evening after everyone got off work, loaded up the camper, and headed on our way. It was a pretty smooth ride until we hit the inclines on Highway 14 where our humongous camper van struggled to maintain a 30mph pace.</p>

<p>The morning after we arrived, we made coffee and breakfast inside of the RV before heading out to explore the area. It was awesome being in the camper and having a nice, comfortable place to hang out, cook, and eat before starting our hike along the Punchbowl Loop Trail.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day a storm began rolling in so after having dinner in the camper (spaghetti bolognese!) we decided to get ourselves a little closer home so we can cut down on the driving the next day. We stopped in a town with a Walmart and asked them if we could park overnight there. After we parked we realized that our grey water tank was overflowing and the water was backing up into the sink (not cool). We headed out to a local dump station and figured out how to dump the grey and black water from the RV before spending the night playing games and hanging out at the Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun hanging out in the RV with everyone and getting out into nature to shoot some photos!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, some friends and I rented a 30&#8242; camper van and drove to an area in the Angeles National Forest known as Devil&#8217;s Punchbowl.</p>
<p>We met up Friday evening after everyone got off work, loaded up the camper, and headed on our way. It was a pretty smooth ride until we hit the inclines on Highway 14 where our humongous camper van struggled to maintain a 30mph pace.</p>

<p>The morning after we arrived, we made coffee and breakfast inside of the RV before heading out to explore the area. It was awesome being in the camper and having a nice, comfortable place to hang out, cook, and eat before starting our hike along the Punchbowl Loop Trail.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day a storm began rolling in so after having dinner in the camper (spaghetti bolognese!) we decided to get ourselves a little closer home so we can cut down on the driving the next day. We stopped in a town with a Walmart and asked them if we could park overnight there. After we parked we realized that our grey water tank was overflowing and the water was backing up into the sink (not cool). We headed out to a local dump station and figured out how to dump the grey and black water from the RV before spending the night playing games and hanging out at the Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun hanging out in the RV with everyone and getting out into nature to shoot some photos!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, some friends and I rented a 30&#8242; camper van and drove to an area in the Angeles National Forest known as Devil&#8217;s Punchbowl.</p>
<p>We met up Friday evening after everyone got off work, loaded up the camper, and headed on our way. It was a pretty smooth ride until we hit the inclines on Highway 14 where our humongous camper van struggled to maintain a 30mph pace.</p>

<p>The morning after we arrived, we made coffee and breakfast inside of the RV before heading out to explore the area. It was awesome being in the camper and having a nice, comfortable place to hang out, cook, and eat before starting our hike along the Punchbowl Loop Trail.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day a storm began rolling in so after having dinner in the camper (spaghetti bolognese!) we decided to get ourselves a little closer home so we can cut down on the driving the next day. We stopped in a town with a Walmart and asked them if we could park overnight there. After we parked we realized that our grey water tank was overflowing and the water was backing up into the sink (not cool). We headed out to a local dump station and figured out how to dump the grey and black water from the RV before spending the night playing games and hanging out at the Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun hanging out in the RV with everyone and getting out into nature to shoot some photos!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last month, some friends and I rented a 30&#8242; camper van and drove to an area in the Angeles National Forest known as Devil&#8217;s Punchbowl.</p>
<p>We met up Friday evening after everyone got off work, loaded up the camper, and headed on our way. It was a pretty smooth ride until we hit the inclines on Highway 14 where our humongous camper van struggled to maintain a 30mph pace.</p>

<p>The morning after we arrived, we made coffee and breakfast inside of the RV before heading out to explore the area. It was awesome being in the camper and having a nice, comfortable place to hang out, cook, and eat before starting our hike along the Punchbowl Loop Trail.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the day a storm began rolling in so after having dinner in the camper (spaghetti bolognese!) we decided to get ourselves a little closer home so we can cut down on the driving the next day. We stopped in a town with a Walmart and asked them if we could park overnight there. After we parked we realized that our grey water tank was overflowing and the water was backing up into the sink (not cool). We headed out to a local dump station and figured out how to dump the grey and black water from the RV before spending the night playing games and hanging out at the Walmart parking lot.</p>
<p>It was a lot of fun hanging out in the RV with everyone and getting out into nature to shoot some photos!</p>
